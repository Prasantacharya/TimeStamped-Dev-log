## Skip-able sob story
The last few years have been a bit of a rough time for me. After graduating university and moving away from home for the first time in 2022, I think I can say that I didn't handle it well. I was pretty lonely, with the only thing I could do was work. Pretty soon, I started developing health problems (probably due to too much work and stress) and things kept on going down hill from there.  

All this to say, I'm attempting to do a hard reset. I've quit my job as of April (genius move in this job market, I know), moved back in with my parent, and I'm starting my masters in the  fall at Georgia Tech to give my self time to reset. And to help calm my mind from the last few years, im going to try and build this side project. This dev log is for this side project which I'm tentatively calling Annotate. 

## Raison d'Ãªtre?

I really like listening to thing. 
It's probably the most common way I consume media of any kind: 
* Books? Ill check out the audio book first. 
* Youtube video - theres an 80% chance I have the video minimized (not necessarily multitasking either - just staring at my wallpaper and focusing on the audio). 
* Same with a movies or shows. 
* And it goes without saying that when I'm working, I usually have something playing in the background to act as basically white noise.

I think it'll come to no surprise that I also do a lot of my learning from podcasts. 
For dev work I never do this (still a ton of trial and error while crying over documentation) but for things like being informed on the [news](https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/whats-news), or learn about [history](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/revolutions_podcast/), [econ](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/127413729/planet-money/), or [politics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) I find myself gravitating towards podcasts as my first option in research.

And when I'm learning, I often find myself wanting to either bookmark specific points in the audio for later or write a note about something interesting I heard. This seems like it should be a solved problem - and with written mediums it is. Books have Post-it notes ~~or just writing in the margin~~. E-books have had bookmarks since forever, and any decent PDF reader allows you to mark up PDF's. However, I don't think there exists a similar tool to do this with audio content.

So thats what I am setting out to create: **A podcast-player type app that allows the user to create and search timestamp-able notes for audio content of any kind.**

My initial plan is to have this work for podcasts and youtube videos, but some say I hope that it might be possible to do this for stuff like zoom calls too - create notes for meetings with timestamps of when they're said so you can go back to them later.
