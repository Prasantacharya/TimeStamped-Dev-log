preview: Why you should unironically use MUMPS
---

[John Harrison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harrison) was a man who's genius is so hard to believe that it borders the fictional (this blog post is still about MUMPS, just bear with me). Although born the son of a carpenter, and it being likely that he never saw a clock in his childhood, he started to show a fascination for clocks at a young age and God's gift for making them. In a time where the accuracy of clocks were measured in how many minutes they gained or lost per day, John Harrison was able to create a [wooden clock](https://www.fairfaxhouse.co.uk/press-release/the-genius-of-john-harrison-revealed-at-fairfax-house/) who's accuracy was measured in **seconds per month** (and at the age of 20). He was so brilliant that he managed create a timepiece previously thought impossible to achieve for centuries - [a watch accurate enough to allow sailors to accurately calculate their longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_longitude). His timepiece [H4](https://www.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/rmgc-object-79142), made in the mid 1700's was only as big as a pocket watch and in the rough conditions of the sea only deviated 3 seconds per day - a watch so accurate that it [rivals mechanical watches made today](https://www.cosc.swiss/en/quality/precision). 

Now, why did I just go off about some genius clock maker from the 18th century? What's this got to do with the database named after a disease? Im opening with this story because I see a lot of parallels between the story of John Harrison's timepieces and MUMPS. Both are the work(s) of unfathomable genius that rival even modern solutions to the same problems. 

That may be fairly obvious for John Harrison's clocks, but I imagine that you would balk at that description for MUMPS. If you have [read anything online about MUMPS](https://thedailywtf.com/articles/a_case_of_the_mumps), you'll come away with the [opposite impression](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36268931). "MUMPS? It's an antiquated relics - it shouldn't be anywhere near the 21st century. Certainly the technology we have today must be orders of magnitude better?" However if you held this view, you would undeniably be wrong to think this, and by the end of this post, I hope you agree.
